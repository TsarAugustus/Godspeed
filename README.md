# Godspeed (WIP Title)

### An idle simulation of a motorsport

This project aims to recreate multiple seasons of a motorsport.

Generate Circuits, Teams, Drivers, Vehicles and Faculty
CEOs will attempt to buy a team, and with their money, build the team from the ground up, including:
	- Team Principals
	- Team Strategists
	- Mechanics
	- Engineers
	- Vehicles
	- Drivers

##### Features to add:
**Faculty**
• Team Logistics Specialists
	- These specialists allow you to get to the track on time, economically. 
	- Poor specialists will make you miss races

**Circuits**
• Circuit Dynamics 
	- Tracks should have grip levels
	- Tracks should have weather that affect grip levels
	- Tracks should be raced at different times of day, to allow more 'faults' to occur


##### Bugs and Issues to resolve:
• Building the path for the track should be less random and have a level of realism involved
