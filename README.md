# Godspeed (WIP Title)

### An idle simulation of a motorsport

This project aims to recreate multiple seasons of a motorsport.

Generate Circuits, Teams, Drivers, Vehicles and Faculty
CEOs will attempt to buy a team, and with their money, build the team from the ground up, including:
	- Team Principals
	- Team Strategists
	- Mechanics
	- Engineers
	- Vehicles
	- Drivers

##### Features to add:
**Faculty**

• Team Logistics Specialists

	- These specialists allow you to get to the track on time, economically. 
	- Poor specialists will make you miss races

**Circuits**

• Circuit Dynamics 

	- Tracks should have grip levels
	- Tracks should have weather that affect grip levels
	- Tracks should be raced at different times of day, to allow more 'faults' to occur
	
**Systems**

• Promotion & Relegation

	- Each Team & Driver should be Promoted or Relegated depending on their placement in the championship
	- Multiple tiers of championships, or 'feeder' series
	- Each Team & Driver should have a 'hometown', or local area, where they are placed against drivers & teams from a similar area

##### Bugs and Issues to resolve:

• Building the path for the track should be less random and have a level of realism involved

##### Todo

• Give faculty a retirement/contract length, similar to drivers. This way they can be swapped around teams, less domination potentially.
• Merge the functions where new teams join and attempt to get faculty, with the function noted above
• Update how drivers behave on circuits. Currently it's a 'rally' for each driver. Drivers should be 'racing' at the same time.
